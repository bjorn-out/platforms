# Getting started with Git and the terminal

## Opening a terminal application

## Using `cd` to get to the right spot

## Creating a new repo on Github and cloning

## Updating, committing and pushing

## Pulling changes from GitHub

## Creating and solving a merge conflict

--> By committing locally, editing something via the GitHub web interface and then pulling in those changes.

Preventing merge conflicts:

- Even when working alone, pull before you commit, unless you always work from a single computer and never edit on the GitHub website.
- When starting to work together with others, try to split up your code into smaller files to reduce chances that you will be working near the same lines of code.
- Don't touch code that you don't need to touch. If you want to clean up, discuss with your partners first and preferably do it after everyone has committed any outstanding changes.

But in a way, merge conflicts are inevitable. There will always be times that your work partially overlaps with that of a partner. No worries, just keep practicing!
