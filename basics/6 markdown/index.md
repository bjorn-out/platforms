# Getting started with Markdown

Read about the basics of Markdown:

<https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>

Now, create a fully-featured README for your Homepage project to describe its purpose and provide as much additional info as you can think of:

<https://readme.so>

Add the new contents of your `README.md` to your own repository and commit and push. Verify that it still looks good on GitHub!

Then mark this assignment as done. As it happens, this completes the **Basics** module!
